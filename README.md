Since my father bought me my first computer in 1984, a Commodore 64, I've been building a tacit knowledge of and love for programming. This knowledge has always been the common denominator throughout my studies and jobs. Sometimes not knowing whether I'm actually an economist or just someone who likes to code tools that economists can use in their day to day routines. But finally I do know what I am.
